/*
Q3) Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level ?

 Ans - To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not
		supported in java.
		
 Example - Consider, three class is there one is child class (A) and two are parents classes (B,C).
 The A class inherits B and classes. If B and C classes have the same method and you call it from 
 child class object, there will be ambiguity to call the method of B or C class.
